# bitVortex - Virtual Coin 'Vortex of Bits'
##### tech: Three.JS, physicsJS

<br>

__*TODO*__
1. ~~create a ball~~
2. make the ball a physics object (should fall down on the screen)
3. put a flat surface object under the ball object
4. angle the "camera" down at the ball hitting the flat surface
5. warp the flat surface into a bowl
6. give the ball object momentum around the bowl
7. finish the bowl into an actual vortex shape
8. apply the vortex texture to the vortex shape
9. introduce more ball physics objects
